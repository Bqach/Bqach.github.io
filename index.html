            Food is the absolute essential to our live but some of us don't have the luxury to have it at least 3 time a day. WHen I make this website I wanted to help families in Christchurch and the CBHS community get a lot of nutritous meal while saving money. This was quite a challenging task as many know that it is hard to beat that 18 dollar deal of your local fish n chip that feed the whole family and is also better than your homecooking. But we still manage to find some way to help you.
