            <div class="Food-des"> Meat Pie is the absolute classic when it come to Kiwis food. It can be the ones that is hot out of your ovens or be bought at your local dairy. I believe this recipe is probably one of the best recipe that you can probably find out there but you don't have to make the pastry and can just find store bought instead. It makes zero differents so if you don't have time or lazy like me just get the frozen ones. You can also reserve it by frozen it, and then later or the day you go to school. Just put it in the refridgerator the night before than bake it in the morning at 200 degree Celcius oven for 20 minutes along with some aluminum foil that is big enough wrap your but not while in the oven(no need to to preheat oven). When it is done, put it in a paper bag (Armamda Lunch Bag from Countdown) to prevent it from get soggy and warp it with the aluminum foil to keep it hot.
